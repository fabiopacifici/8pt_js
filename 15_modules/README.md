# JS Modules and terminal commands

This lesson introduces two key tools, the command line and JavaScript modules.
Below the key concepts, you will find practical exercises to reinforce your understanding.

## Basic Terminal's commands (Linux based)

- `cd`: Change directory
- `ls`: List files in a directory
- `mkdir`: Create a new directory
- `rm`: Remove files or directories
- `cp`: Copy files or directories
- `mv`: Move or rename files or directories

## JS Modules

- common js syntax
- mjs syntax

## TODO

Use the basic terminal commands to create a new directory for your project, navigate into it, and create a new JavaScript file.
Define inside the file two functions and export them. Then, create another JavaScript file that imports and uses these functions.

Repeat the same process using both syntaxes (CommonJS and ES Modules).
> NOTE: You cannot run the code in the browser with the commonjs syntax. It is intended to run using nodejs.
